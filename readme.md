**Exercise Name:** Random Name Generator  
**Description:**  
- Built a themed web application that pulls student and instructor names from a local JSON file.  
  Students are called **"CSA Superstars"** and instructors are called **"The Authority"**.  
  The app features arcade-inspired styling, responsive design, and interactive name generation.

### What was done :
- Created a randomized function triggered by button clicks to display names.  
- Styled the UI with neon arcade effects, glowing animations, and responsive layouts for mobile/tablet.  
- Added a **history tracker** that displays the last five names generated.  
- Set up the basic HTML structure and CSS styling with a wrestling-themed background.  
- Created a **JSON data file** containing full names with WWE nicknames, emails, and Slack handles.  
- Used **fetch logic** to pull data dynamically from `data.json`.  
- Applied **console logging** to show full contact information (name, email, Slack) whenever a name is selected.  
- Added **color differentiation**:  
  - CSA Superstars appear in cyan glow.  
  - The Authority names appear in red glow.

**Comments : Very unique style you have here, I do notice that when you aren't in full screen you will see that you have to scroll to make sure you can see the content as well as having to scroll up and down on the actual card you have in the center. Overall it's a good project very well done so far** -- Resolved
